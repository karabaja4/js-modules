# AMD

AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is another specification for modules. 

RequireJS is probably the most popular implementation of AMD.

One major difference from CommonJS is that AMD specifies that modules are loaded asynchronously - that means modules are loaded in parallel, as opposed to blocking the execution by waiting for a load to finish.
